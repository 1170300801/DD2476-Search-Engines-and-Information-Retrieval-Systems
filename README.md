# DD2476-Search-Engines-and-Information-Retrieval-Systems
Individual assignments for the course Search Engines and Information Retrieval Systems at KTH Royal Institute of technology


Information Retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature that satisfies an information need from within
large collections (usually stored on computers). 

Assignment 1: Boolean Retrieval

The purpose of Assignment 1 is to learn how to build an inverted index. You will learn 1) how build a basic inverted index; 2) how to handle multiword queries; 
3) how to handle phrase queries; 4) how to evaluate a search system; and 5) techniques for handling large indexes.
In realistic applications, we of course cannot index the whole document collection every time we start the search engine. Moreover, the complete index would be too large to fit in working memory.
